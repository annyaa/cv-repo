## Why Quarto?

When I decided to create a personal website to showcase my CV and share my thoughts through blog posts, I explored several options. I previously had a simple Jekyll-based site that displayed my CV, but I wanted something more flexible and modern that could support blogging alongside my academic profile.

After researching various static site generators, I chose **Quarto** for several compelling reasons:

1. **Built for scientific and technical content**: As a PhD student in Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Biosciences, I need a platform that handles scientific writing naturally, including support for citations, equations, and code.

2. **Unified authoring**: Quarto allows me to write everything in Markdown (.qmd files) with seamless integration of code, figures, and text - perfect for future posts about computational biology and data analysis.

3. **Modern and actively maintained**: Developed by Posit (formerly RStudio), Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown with excellent documentation and active community support.

4. **Easy deployment**: GitHub Actions integration makes it simple to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages whenever I push changes.

## Setting Up the Site

### Project Structure

Here's how I organized my Quarto website:

```
cv-repo/
├── _quarto.yml           # Main configuration file
├── index.qmd             # Homepage with CV
├── blog.qmd              # Blog listing page
├── posts/                # Blog posts directory
│   ├── _metadata.yml     # Shared post configuration
│   └── 2026-02-17-creating-this-website/
│       └── index.qmd     # This post!
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── publish.yml    # GitHub Actions workflow
```

### Configuration Highlights

The `_quarto.yml` file is the heart of the site configuration. I set up:

- A clean **cosmo theme** that looks professional for an academic CV
- A **navigation bar** linking to the Home (CV) and Blog pages
- **Search functionality** to help visitors find content
- A **footer** with my GitHub link
- **RSS feed** support for blog subscribers

### Migrating My CV

Converting my CV from Jekyll to Quarto was straightforward:

1. Renamed `index.md` to `index.qmd` (Quarto Markdown)
2. Added YAML front matter with a proper title
3. Integrated a **listing component** to show my 3 most recent blog posts right on the homepage
4. Cleaned up formatting (removed some stray brackets in the original)

The CV now displays my education, research experience, and skills in a clean, readable format while also showcasing my latest writing.

## Blog Setup

### How Blog Posts Work

Each blog post lives in its own subdirectory under `posts/` with an `index.qmd` file. This approach keeps posts organized and makes it easy to include images or other assets alongside each post.

The `posts/_metadata.yml` file sets default configuration for all posts:

- `freeze: true` - Caches execution results, which speeds up rendering
- `author: "Ann Safo"` - Sets my name as the default author

### Listing Pages

I created two listing pages:

1. **Homepage listing** (`index.qmd`): Shows the 3 most recent posts to give visitors a quick preview
2. **Full blog listing** (`blog.qmd`): Displays all posts sorted by date with category filters

Quarto's listing feature automatically generates these pages from the post metadata, creating a beautiful, functional blog without any custom code.

## GitHub Actions Deployment

The real magic happens with GitHub Actions, which automatically builds and deploys my site whenever I push changes to the main branch.

### The Workflow

My `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file defines a workflow that:

1. **Checks out** the repository code
2. **Sets up Quarto** using the official Quarto action
3. **Renders** the site to the `_site/` directory
4. **Uploads** the rendered site as an artifact
5. **Deploys** to GitHub Pages

### Enabling GitHub Pages

To make this work, I configured my repository settings:

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Ensure proper workflow permissions are enabled

Now, every push to main triggers an automatic deployment. Within a few minutes, my changes are live!

## What's Next?

Now that the infrastructure is in place, I'm excited to start blogging about:

- My PhD research on mosquito invasion dynamics
- Computational biology techniques and bioinformatics workflows
- Data analysis tips in R and Python
- Reflections on graduate school and scientific research

The beauty of Quarto is that I can easily include code, figures, and interactive visualizations in future posts, making it perfect for sharing my computational work.
